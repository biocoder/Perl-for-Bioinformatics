# This is the configuration file, where you can specify the command line
# options for each of the modules of lncRNApipe. If you do not wish to
# run any of the modules, simply, disable them and all the lines following
# it (if, any) by prefixing it with #
#
# 
#
# Specify output directory.
# In the example below, a  new output directory called "run"
# will be created at the mentioned path  /data/konganti/lncRNApipe-test.
#
outputDir: /data/konganti/lncRNApipe-test/run

#
# Indicate, if we should overwrite the output directory if it already exists.
#
# WARNING: THIS WILL REMOVE ANY FILES / DIRECTORIES 
#
overwriteOutputDir: NO

#
# Let lncRNApipe know if you intend to perform transcript assembly
# using tophat / cufflinks or just identify ncRNAs from already
# assembled transcripts.
#
performTranscriptAssembly: YES

#
# Specify number of threads / CPUs to use where possible.
# If running on a grid, each job script will run with this many
# number of CPUs.
#
# ********************* !! IMPORTANT !! ***********************
# *************************************************************
#
# Please be aware that each command will take this many number
# of CPUs. If you have 2 samples, then 2 tophat runs will take
# 10 CPUs each etc... In case of grid computing, this is easily
# managed via job parameters but if you not using grid computing, 
# please make sure you are not exceeding the total number of CPUs
# available on your machine. 
#
# For example, if you are not using grid computing and your  machine 
# has 24 CPUs, and you have 6 samples including all replicates, 
# you may want to use as rule of thumb: 
#
# Desired number of CPUs = Total number of CPUs divided by total
# number of samples (including replicates, if any)
# 
CPUs: 16

#
# Specify scheduler type.
# Valid options are PBS, SGE, LSF, SLURM or NONE to disable grid computing.
#
scheduler: SGE

#
# Mention batch submission command.
# For example, for LSF, it is bsub, for PBS or SGE, it
# is qsub and in case you are not running jobs on the cluster, change
# it to BASH.
#
batchSubCmd: qsub

#
# Specify scheduler options on separate line
# specific to your job running environment.
#
# ********************* !! IMPORTANT !! ***********************
# *************************************************************
#
# Different clusters uses different job parameter names. For
# example our cluster uses num_threads as parameter name to
# request number of CPUs in SGE. Some clusters may use
# num_cpu. Since it is difficult to guess, please provide
# number of CPUs you want to use based on your grid environment
# below, which is equal to "CPUs:" option above. Yes, we know that
# this is kind of redundant but it is necessary evil. What ever
# job parameters you provide after the - , they will appear
# exactly in the job script.
#
# IF IT IS NOT PROVIDED, THE JOB WILL RUN ON SINGLE CPU.
#
# *************************************************************

#
# Ex for PBS (job parameters start with a PBS directive):
#
# PBS -V
# PBS -l nodes=1:ppn=16,walltime=24:00:00

# Ex for SGE (job parameters start with $ sign):

#
# Specify if your reads are SE (single-end only), PE (paired-end only) or MIXED
#
libType: MIXED

#
# Specify if you want to use ENSEMBL or UCSC as source for annotation.
# "PLEASE MAKE SURE" that you are using the same sourceDB for tophat
# alignment, i.e. bowtie indexes created from the same sourceDB for the
# same assembly version. As downloding genome indices on-the-fly is time
# consuming and since many users may have genome indices installed for
# various NGS analysis anyways, we leave it to you to provide "CORRECT"
# genome index below in tophat and cufflinks options' configuration.
#
sourceDB: ENSEMBL

#
# Choose assembly version so that we can download up-to-date annotation on the fly.
# You can choose to supply your own annotation file for consistency below.
# ENSEMBL and UCSC represents species name differently in the URLs.
# To view species names for ENSEMBL do, "perl lncRNApipe --list ENSEMBL".
# Go to https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQreleases.html#TOP to view UCSC version names.
# For example, at UCSC, for mouse, it is mm9 or mm10, for rat, it is rn5 or rn6 etc...
#
species: Danio_rerio.Zv9.66

#
# If you want to use your own annoation file, provide full path to the annotation
# file of your choice. This option overrides "sourceDB: " and "species: " options above.
# Again, "PLEASE MAKE SURE", you are providing the same genome index from the

# from FASTA files from UCSC.

# Provide Unix path to directory where the read files are located and also

#
# PLEASE MAKE SURE THE READS ARE IN ORDER. DO NOT MIX AND MATCH READ ORDERS.
# WE HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING WHICH READ FILE IS _1 or _2.

# In the example below, it is assumed that you have already created a transcriptome
